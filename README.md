# Vehler
Vehler is a Vehicle Management System built in Java using Microsoft Access as the database and SQL for queries.

The aim of this project was to develop an offline application that could manage vehicles, drivers as well as the passengers could book the rides.

## Background

Vehler ia a project that I developed when I was in my first year of University. This project is really close to my heart because I developed it after the hardwork of one month. For someone who had no experience in programming 6 months before this project, I believe it was a great achievement for me at that time. As I made it in my 2nd semester when I had started programming just 6 months ago. I still remember those sleepless nights. I thought it'd be cool to put it on GitHub. Maybe a student could benefit from it.
## Modules:

There are mainly 5 modules in this software.

Admin can add new vehicles, and manage them.

A new driver can sign up, pick up the kind of vehicle he drives and he'll be alloted a vehicle according to his selection. He can then turn his status as online and start picking rides.

New passengers can sign up and log in into the system to book rides. They can book a ride, check their current rides and also past rides.

Admin can manage the rides going on. An admin can even ban a driver.

Ride booking is done by the passengers where they can choose from 3 types of vehicles i.e. Bus, Rickshaw and Car. They have to select the routes and begin the travelling.
